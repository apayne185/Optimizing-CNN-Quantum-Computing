install requirements.txt

**if you are on windows, follow these instructions:
1. open powershell as admin
2. wsl -- install
3. sudo apt update
4. sudo apt update python3 python3-pip
5. pip install tensorflow-quantum 

tensorflow-quantum is not compatible with windows, so we need to use WSL (windows subsystem for linux) for a linux environment to install
